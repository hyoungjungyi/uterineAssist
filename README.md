# uterineAssist
.
this repo calculates uterus / endo lengths based on various methods  
1. using the greatest incircle  
2. following the skeleton, use the orthogonal line as the width (2px interval/5px interval/7px interval)  
3. following the skeleton, regress the line of 5px and use its orthogonal line as the width
all methods are coded in main.py  
results of uterus width > uterus_thickness  
results of endo width > endo_thickness
